# Easy Chemistry

Easy chemistry is an application dedicated to organising chemistry lab experiments. User can add or delete experiment categories, methods, titles of any experiments they choose. This application is a great tool for Leaving Certificate students as they need to complete 28 chemistry lab expriments within 2 year period. They can add each experiment to the app with completion date managing they can track their progress and treat the app as revision tool. Easy chemistry is not only limited to chemistry, students can add any leaving cert experiemnts from, different subjects such as Biology, Physics and any applied science subjects can be added too. Person studying more than one science subject means they need to know around 60, 90 or 120 experiments which can be very stressful and easy to miss. 


Easy chemistry can be used by anyone that has a passiom for chemistry subject. This app enables to save favourite experiments, also updating them with any new developments to the method. Very useful for reaserch students to keep tract of their experiemntal methods.

## UX design:

### Navbar:

The navbar at the top contains the name of the app on the left-hand side making the user aware of the name of this app. The navbar contains sections related to the funntionality of the website. Chemistry experiments section takes the user to the list of the experiments user previously added. New experiment will take the user to the page where the new experiment can be added. Manage categoriues takes the user to add categories page pf the app. This makes the app very easy to navigate through desired sections of the app. Names are strongly linked with the functionality of the page. 

### Side navbar:

Side navbar burger icon shows when the screen from 9992 x 821. Burger icon the right side of the navbar leads the user to open a side navbar with sections that would normally be found in a larger screen size navbar on the right-hand side such as Chemsitry Experiments, New Experiments and Manage Categories. 


### Slider:

Section slider contains three images that are liked to the labolatory work such as labolatory glassware and chemicals in the glassware. Each section in the slider suggests different ways of using the app in large white text. The whote text is very easy for a user to read as each image is mostly very dark. The slider shows each image in a fixed time intervals automatically which shows the user all suggested wasy of using this app. 

### Main section:

Underneath the slider the user insantly can see the list of all the category experiments previously entered. The date can be entered to note the due date of completion or due daye of the exam/test the experiment should be revised for. There is an edit and delete button in different colours to help to distiguish between two different button finctionalities. The edit button takes the suer to another page where an experiment can be edited. Detele button deletes the experiment. The fuctionality and name displayed on the button are linked.

There is a dropdown arrow above the buttons revealing the name and method of the experiment when clicked. 


### Footer:

The footer is the same colour as the navbar to make the contents look cleaner. Footer contains Easy chemistry name, copyright sign and a year. Underneath the user is encouraged to follow Easy chemistry on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Googleplus and Pinterest. These are quite large for user to see and click.

## Existing features:

Alibity to add a new experiment using 'New experiment' button on the right-hand side of the navbar and filling in the form with experiment details, 'Submit new experiment' button will add the experiment

Alibity to add a new category using 'Manage Categories' button on the right-hand side of the navbar and then 'Add experiment category' button leading to a new entry category field with 'Add category' button 

Alibity to edit an existing experiment using 'Edit' button present beside every experiment entered which leads to an editing form. 'Edit experiment' button will submit edited experiemnt. 

Alibity to edit an existing category using 'Manage Categories' button on the right-hand side of the navbar that leads to the list of categories. Each category has an edit button that leads to an entry category field, 'Edit category' button submits the edited category name. 

Ability to delete experiment by clicking a delete button present beside every experiment entered. 

Ability to delete category button on the right-hand side of the navbar that leads to the list of categories. Each category has an delete button that deletes chosen category.  

Ability to view experiments name and methods with a date to complete/revise the content by clicking the arrow pointing down beside each existing experiment. 

Footer icons that lead to various web pages where Easy Chemistry could potentially have a social media account. These icons lead to main pages of these websites for now.


## Features left to implement:

Ability to add images to each experimental method steps. 
Ability to add a video on how to perform each experiment. 
Ability to share experiments with other users. 
Footer icons that lead to actual real Easy Chemistry social media accounts. 

## Technologies used:

HTML was used to create a website design and layout. 

CSS was mainly used to style the website. 

Javascript was used to create responsive, interactive elemements that enhance the user experience. 

Flask written in python microframework was used to conncet database to HTML based graphical user interfaces for experiemnt creation and editing.

MongoDB-backed Flask project was used to allow the user to store and manipulate data records of domain. 

Materialize css was used to create main navigation menu, side nabbar, footer, and slider. 

Heroku was used to deploy the final version of the code to a hosting platform. 

Githu and Git was used as a version control. 



## Testing:

The website was continuously tested for the responsiveness. The layout was tested on how it will look on the desktop, tablet and a mobile phone.  

Google inspect was used to check if the layout and style would be matching with the other features of the website. 

The website was tested using Google Chrome as this is currently the most popular search engine.  

The functionality of the button,navbar and social media footer logos was tested. 

The website was tested on the Responsinator to ensure good working website. 


### Device testing:
This website was tested on the following devices:

Samsung galaxy s9 and s5

Samsung Tablet A

Huawei p30

Toshiba Satellite laptop 

## Deployment:

Heroku was used to deploy the final version of the application code. Heroku is one of the preferred platform among developers due to scalability and polymorphism. I allows developers build, run and scale applications in similar way across all programming languages. 

Information listed in the website below was used to deploy the app to heroku
https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment

Code institute tutorial video on how to depoky the app to heroku was also used.
